//Jumpy Ball
//You have a jumpy ball. You throw it up from the ground up to a height of H. The ball is jumpy, so when it comes back to the ground, it 
/rebounds and goes up again to a distance of floor(H/2).
//This keeps on repeating until it can't rebound anymore. You need to find the total distance traveled by the ball.
//Solution in JAVA

class Solution{
    static long jumpyBall(long N){
        // code here
        long distance = 2*N;
        long c;
        while(N>0){
            c = N/2;
            distance += 2*c;
            N = N/2;
            
        }
        return  distance;

    }
}
